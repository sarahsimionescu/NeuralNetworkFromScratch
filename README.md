# NeuralNetworkFromScratch
I decided to create a simple back propagation neural network from scratch in C++ as part of my final project for my Scientific Computing course (DATASCI 2G03).

## Instructions for Use
**Read the project proposal to learn about the model and how it works!**
  1. Unzip the training data and training labels
  2. Enter the paths to each respective dataset file in `demo.cpp`
  3. Run `make`
  4. Run `./demo` and the output to the terminal will describe the program as it runs.

## Environment Information
- Running on CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
- gcc (GCC) version 4.8.5 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44)
